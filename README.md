# Globular-Clusters
Codes I've developed to work with CCD globular cluster data.

(1) fitting.py: fits a Gaussian distribution to the data.


(2) enrichMMR.py: simulation of the enrichment a globular cluster as it crosses and metal-rich cloud in a massive galaxy



(3) mmrFit.py: Run (2) first. (2) will output model parameters calculated, make some needed calculations (final mass, change from luminosity to magnitude to color to metallicity) and over plot them on the observed data.
